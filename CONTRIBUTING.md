Note that this is a project I'm hoping to make a few bucks off of, so I will not
accept PRs - both because it would be legally ambiguous, and also clearly
unethical to accept free work for a not-free service.

Note also that all rights to this source code are reserved. The code is open
source for the purpose of education and transparency, but I issue no license for
any other use. For example, it's OK to run this code on your machine to learn;
it's not OK to deploy a persistent clone of this service on a domain you own
where users on the internet could sign up.

Details about setting up the development environment for this project are in
./HACKING.md, should you wish to learn more!
